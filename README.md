# CSS

Time to prettify your websites!

## Steps

1. Fork and clone [this repository](https://github.com/JoinCODED/TASK-Masterclass-M10-CSS).
2. Install the dependencies using `npm i`.
3. Start the BE & FE servers using `npm start` (`concurrently` is set up, so you do not have to worry about anything).

## Selectors

Use this [link](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_selectors.asp) to your advantage.

1. Install `css resets` using `npm i the-new-css-reset`.
2. Go through the docs [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/the-new-css-reset#npm-and-how-to-use) to set up the resets.
3. See how the navbar on top of your website looks ugly, we want it to look like an actual navbar.
4. Add a SASS stylesheet with some CSS so that your navbar is on one line (horizontally).
5. If the CSS resets have not removed the `list-style`, then make sure to remove them because we do not want them.
6. Make sure your navbar is spaced out evenly and add pipes between each nav item (HINT: use either the `::before` or `::after` selectors).
   - **Note** you may not use HTML to add the pipes, use only CSS to add them
